At the same time, appoint a guardian to take care of all her affairs.  After a considerable improvement in her condition, Nira and Monas from the South Bureau arrived to examine the continued release.  In a joint conversation with Yehuda, it seems that he is interested in being appointed as a guardian for her in order to take care of her interests.

In light of her condition and inability to return home in the absence of adequate care, she was presented with complex nursing care, amid tube feeding, pressure sores and the need for medical supervision.	3448459	22161204	f	90	yes		widowed	0			100				yes	no	yes		home	nursing_home

The patient is treated at home by his son Eli and receives a maximum of hours from the National Insurance Institute and the Holocaust Survivors' Fund. He was hospitalized a few weeks ago and returned home. His condition is more difficult respiratory and functional. He had BIPAP at home before but returned when he returned from rehabilitation because he did not have to. Now there is once again a question of whether he needs BIPAP. He uses the class but has not yet been booked for it. He has oxygen in the house and he uses oxygen 24 hours a day. It may be suitable for complex nursing because of oxygen and BIPAP if it is decided to transfer it to an institution. The family feels that it is very difficult for them to take care of him at home. They considered putting him in a nursing home in Hod Jerusalem. They were explained the difference between nursing and complex nursing. They are still in the decision process.  A question of guardianship arose. The patient himself sounds clear today but communication with him is difficult both because of a hearing problem and he was without a device and also because his speech is not clear. The patient said he did not want a nursing home because he would be depressed to see sick people around him all the time. He wants to be at home and he knows that his son Eli can continue to take care of him.

There are two oral insulin alternatives that are suitable for the patient due to her kidney condition, Genovia 25 and Targenta 5, both of which are not in the basket. I had a repeat conversation with the daughter who would have difficulty buying the medication due to the high price, agreed to learn to use an insulin syringe. Throughout the conversation, the daughter cried and shared her fear of injections. I thought together with her about other family members who can get the guidance but Nada is the main caregiver who takes care of her mother every day and the other siblings live far away from them. The daughter agreed to undergo insulin instruction herself.  The patient was released to her home after the ward nurse was under the impression that the daughter understood the importance of the treatment and was able to inject into her mother.	4610998	27134965	f	83			widowed	6	at_home	at_home	0								home		
82 years old, familiar to me from the previous hospitalization a few weeks ago. Aharon lives in Kiryat Menachem (paid privately). There is a guardian - son Moody (050-6216100). Prior to hospitalization in the nursing home, the family was told that he would not be able to stay in the nursing home for a long time due to his condition (grade 4 pressure ulcer) and that a complex nursing setting should be considered. This was also reported by the doctors in the ward.  Note that in the previous hospitalization I talked about it with my son Itzik. The family, the ward and also the nursing home were aware of his condition and there was agreement that he would return there and continue to live there for the time being. Now due to the repeated hospitalizations, his condition requires rethinking.  I spoke with my son Itzik (0524731997), although those who are very satisfied with Kiryat Menachem understand that the place is no longer suitable for his needs. The only place they agree to go is Misgav Ladach (Hod and French are not interested, Herzog I explained is irrelevant). According to him, in Kiryat Menachem they agree that he will return there until a place is found. Waiting for the letter to introduce him to complex nursing. I updated Dr. Nemesnik, tomorrow you will enter the patient and his family.  Continued treatment.    15.8.16- Today the attending physician and I had a conversation with Itzik Jr. and Hadassah the patient's wife. It was explained to the family that even if the nursing home agrees to receive him back, this is not the recommendation of The treating staff, the place is not suitable for him and he returns from there dehydrated for repeated and multiple hospitalizations (in the last few weeks - four hospitalizations!). We also talked about the options for complex nursing. We asked that we send the letter a summary to all places except Hod Adumim, where they do not agree to release him under any circumstances. .Try to try to make connections in Misgav Ladach. Today a conversation with Dr. Nemesnik.  Note that the family is very involved and caring. I talked to his wife Hadassah, who looks exhausted and very sad. She said she was tired from his repeated hospitalizations here, wanting a good place for him to take care of his needs. She also said that they are a bereaved family, their son died about 22 years ago of lymph node cancer.  Then the son Moody also came and asked that I also talk to him since he is the guardian. We talked and I presented him with the possibilities.  When there is a summary letter, I will send to all the places requested.   17.8.16- I forwarded the letter to Misgav Ladach, French and Herzog at the request of the family. The letters arrived but I was told from all the places that there are currently no places .. I updated my son Itzik, said that there were both in Misgav Ladach and in France. They will try to speed things up on their part as well.   21.8.16- I spoke with Eyal from Leumit, they will try to advance matters with the Frenchman but there is a very long waiting list, in Misgav there is a priority for Meuhedet and therefore also there they are not expected to receive him soon .. If they do not agree to go wait in Hod, they may proceed to stop funding.    29.8.16- There are still no places in France and Misgav Ladach. Dr. Nemesnik talked to the family and talked to them about stopping the hospitalization. They were very angry and even threatened to call the police to the ward. They  still refuse to move to Hod Adumim either temporarily.  I also contacted the relief clerk Yael Rechbi who was involved at the time. Incision in the testicle), I updated her on the development of his condition and the pressure sore that started in the groin.   1.9.16 - The results of the shots were repeated - a Marsa shot from the nose was positive.

In a conversation with her sister Charlotte, she said that she lives alone in Bat Yam, is not willing to bring help from Social Security into her home, because she is getting along. To my impression and the opinion of the doctors is clear. In Anat Hertz's conversation with the Legal Bureau, they will be transferred to the community in order to appoint a guardian by review due to the complexity of her situation. At the request of the Legal Bureau I will send a report describing the information I received from her sister.  2/6 It was decided to invite Daniela to a court hearing to express her opinion regarding the guardianship following the ups and downs in confusion. After the decision on the hearing was made there was another incident of confusion. Daniela lay in bed and covered her head with a blanket, did not agree to shower or eat nor did she agree to have her diaper changed even though it was completely full. She said she "killed a baby" and "can't eat because then the baby in my womb will die." Was very confused until noon which calmed down a bit. I reported to the legal bureau by phone about the additional incident and we agreed that we would be in touch again tomorrow to see if there was a need for a hospital hearing and not for her to appear in court.  3/6 At the request of the Legal Bureau I faxed them a report of the incident that took place yesterday, to fax 6752363.

In addition, it was decided that she would move to a convalescent home in Jerusalem.	3576216	21505408	f	79			single				0	yes			yes	no	yes		home	nursing_home

David was tired and very weak, did not take part in the conversation. Reuven asked us to talk near the room because he was afraid to leave his father alone. Out of the room and Reuben went in to check that everything was fine every time Shosh coughed. He says that he now has difficulty expelling due to swallowing difficulties and is therefore very afraid of suffocation. He   says that until before the cardio hospital David was functionally reserved. No help was needed at home. Reuven is with him most of the day at home and when he is not there someone else is present. Contact Social Security and get a permit for 10 hours. Reuben does not know if this is a reduction in hours due to income or if this is what he was approved for.

He noted that he often offered his father to move in with him but he refused. He stated that he tried to increase hours in the BTA but was refused and therefore could not arrange a foreign worker for him. I agreed with him that I would submit a request for Dad to increase hours for Social Security, I explained to him that someone from the family must come with him in light of his confusion.  01.10.20- The ward nurse updated that Asher the patient's son came to visit him for a short time.
